Task 17: the group name associated with all my files is notre-dame

Task 20: for the doErr-NoErr.txt, the only contents are the parts of the stdout that did not cause any errors. As for the doErr-StdErr.txt, it contained both the valid output as well as the error message that came with the invalid print statement.
