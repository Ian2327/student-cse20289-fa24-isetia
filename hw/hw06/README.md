Task 3d: if file is not a .cc file, the code will just run as normal (however, will probably will print 0 for all values other than lines)

Task 4: although my hw6searchsrc code will run on non .cc files, the hw6searchdir will filter on the .cc files, so that no other types of files will be scanned

Task 5: must do 'chmod +x doTests.sh' to enable executable form

Task 6:
- Bugs (hw6searchsrc):

- Bugs (hw6searchdir):
